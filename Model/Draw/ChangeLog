	* PenDraw.cs, Selector.cs, LineDraw.cs, DrawBase.cs: Changed all refereces
	  to SetValue<T>, now using the non parametrized method SetValue() because
	  the generic version was removed from Moonlight. Removed References to
	  System.Windows.Offset()

	* Selector.cs: Using Rectangle instead SelectionRectangle. Now the selection
	  is shown.

	* Selector.cs: Small trick, to make control points work.
