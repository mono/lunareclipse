	* Controls/TimeLine/KeyframeMarker.cs: Overrode SetValue<T> to set
	  width/heiht on the  child

2007-08-06  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs: Correctly recording the changing movements.
	* LunarEclipse.mdp, Serialization/Serializer.cs,
	  Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: The serializer is now much faster
	  than before as i have a white-list of attached properties which i need
	  to check as opposed to brute forcing everything.
	* Serialization/PropertyData.cs: Storing more information than before (such
	  as whether the property is attached or not) which greatly simplifies
	  usage of the data.

2007-08-06  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs, Properties/PropertyGroupLayout.cs,
	  Properties/PropertyGroupAppearance.cs: Commented out the property code
	  until it can be changed to work with the new data structures
	* Serialization/Serializer.cs, Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Smarter
	  serializer. Now only prints the fully qualified name when necessary.

2007-08-06  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Serialization/Serializer.cs: Removed excess console.writelines
	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Refactored to make better use of my
	  existing code. Seems to be picking up all the attached properties and
	  serializing them correctly now.

2007-08-06  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs,

2007-08-02  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Cosmetic

2007-08-02  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controls/TimeLine/KeyframeMarker.cs: Fixed more rendering issues from
	  the change to inheriting from Control instead of shape

2007-08-02  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Initial refactor to make things compliant with the refresh.

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs,
	  Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs, LunarEclipse.mdp,

	  so you can record animations

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Removed comment out crap

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	The rotation undo'ing now works right. I misunderstood attached properties ;)

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Model/Draw/Selector.cs,
	  Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs, Model/Draw/DrawBase.cs,
	  Controller/UndoEngine.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs,
	  LunarEclipse.mdp: Seperated out the selection code out so that it
	  can be reused for the Animation recorder. Events kick ass ;)

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Rather than storing an Undo item for every small change in one group, if there is an existing undo object that changes the same property, it is updated instead

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs, Controller/UndoActions/UndoMoveShape.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoActionBase.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoPropertyChange.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoGroup.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoAddObject.cs, LunarEclipse.mdp: Now
	  using the new UndoGroup. Greatly simplifies the undo logic for
	  events that change multiple properties at the same time.

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* LunarEclipse.mdp: Update the undo code to be able to undo rotations
	  in a transform group

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Cosmetic

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Bugfix: Now plays nicely with a TransformGroup as the RenderTransform as opposed to a rotateTransform

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/SelectedBorder.cs, Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Switched to
	  using TransformGroup rather than an actual RotateTransform

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	An angle of -10 actually corresponds to a true angle of 350. This fixes rotating with a negative angle

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Switching to the XAML view cleans up the current draw item in a better way

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controller/MoonlightController.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/DrawBase.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs: Fixed the
	  bug where the SelectionDraw wasn't preparing until the first mouse
	  click (which meant it wouldn't select on the first mouse click)

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Controller/Recorder.cs,
	  Controls/TimeLine/KeyframeMarker.cs,

	  animation handling

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  correctly displayed onscreen now

2007-07-25  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs: Now moving existing shapes
	  around the canvas rather than clearing the children and creating
	  new visuals each time. Much faster.

2007-07-25  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Added the Recorder class used for recording animations

2007-07-25  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs,
	  Controls/TimeLine/TimelineMarker.cs, LunarEclipse.mdp,
	  View/MainWindow.cs, View/GtkMoonlight.cs: Implemented initial
	  version of the animation timeline

	  incrementing twice.

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Refactored the code to be much shorter

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Resizing now works for all rotation angles

2007-07-18  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

2007-07-17  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/Properties.cs: Added in supporting code for the Brush
	  group
	* Properties/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs: Initial implementation of the
	  PropertyGroup for brushes
	* Properties/PropertyGroupLayout.cs: Updated to use the
	  ReflectionHelper
	* Properties/PropertyGroup.cs: Bugfixed the SelectedBorder property
	* Properties/PropertyGroupAppearance.cs: Using Enum helper methods
	  where appropriate. Using ReflectionHelper. Fixes so operations are
	  performed on the selected shape rather than the selection canvas
	  surrounding that shape.
	* Serialization/Serializer.cs: updated to work with the new static
	  reflection helper
	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Reflection helper is now a
	  threadsafe static class.

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	Display the type of the object that is selected

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	  widht/height through resizing now.

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Selecting/deselecting is now a lot
	  faster when using the selection rectangle. I don't regenerate the
	  entire list of selected shapes every time.

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	  placed inside it.

2007-07-06  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SquareDraw.cs, Model/Draw/CircleDraw.cs: Constrained
