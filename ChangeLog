2007-08-24  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Serialization/PropertyData.cs: Added some comments

2007-08-24  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs: Fixed logic for changing a property which
	  hasn't been changed before. It now correctly starts changing after the
	  previous keyframe

2007-08-24  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs: Resetting the shapes to their original values
	  before replaying the animation
	* Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs: Update for logic behind adding a
	  keyframe to a property which hasn't been previously animated to have a
	  more logical affect

2007-08-24  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/Selector.cs: Using the toolbox global event so alerts are
	  passed out for changing the angle
	* Controller/MoonlightController.cs: Cleaning up before serializing so
	  non-silverlight types don't get serialised
	* Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs: Added ability to modify existing
	  keyframe. Fixed check for duplicate keyframes
	* View/MainWindow.cs: Fixed vbox packing

2007-08-23  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  Points and Brushes

2007-08-23  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controller/UndoActions/UndoGroup.cs: I need the explicit implementation
	  too.
	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs: Fixed the remaining buglets due to special
	  casing of Canvas.Left/Canvas.Top

2007-08-23  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	

2007-08-23  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs, Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Removed the
	  special casing for Canvas.Left and Canvas.Top for animations. A better
	  approach would be to massage all Timelines before they are
	  run/serialised rather than doing on-the-fly re-routing
	* Controller/UndoActions/UndoGroup.cs: Added ienumerable so you can
	  enumerate all the undos in the group

2007-08-23  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/SelectedBorder.cs: Refactored the CreateCircle and SetCircle
	  methods. No more redundant creation of brushes

	  properties silently which was breaking animations

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs, View/MainWindow.cs,
	  Properties/PropertyManager.cs: Added the ability to change the
	  NameProperty -> All storyboards correctly update

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/PropertyType.cs: Added new enums

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Cosmetic

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  otherwise updating existing widgets

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs: removed excess writelines and made the undos
	  silent

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controller/UndoActions/UndoPropertyChange.cs: Added the ability to change
	  the property 'silently' rather than always firing the global property
	  changed event.

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controller/UndoActions/UndoGroup.cs: Cosmetic

2007-08-22  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  Controls/TimeLine/KeyframeMarker.cs,
	  Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs, View/MainWindow.cs,
	  View/PropertyGroupLayout.cs, Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Removed
	  calls to Toolbox.ChangeProperty for properties that shouldn't announce
	  their change globally. Reimplemented the Property Changing code.

2007-08-21  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/PropertyManager.cs: Hooking into the Selected and deselected
	  events so that the propertypane appears and disappears correctly. More
	  properties are editable now. All property changes correctly update the
	  selection pane (if there is one).

2007-08-21  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/SelectionChangedEventArgs.cs: I have no idea what the 'Selected'
	  property was supposed to be for. Removed it, it's useless.

2007-08-21  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/Selector.cs: Now firing the ItemDeselected event.

2007-08-21  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* LunarEclipse.mdp, View/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs,
	  View/PropertyGroupLayout.cs, View/PropertyGroupAppearance.cs,
	  Properties/PropertyInfo.cs, Properties/PropertyGroup.cs,
	  Properties/PropertyGroupAppearance.cs, Serialization/PropertyData.cs,
	  Serialization/Serializer.cs, Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Using
	  the 'ShortName' property instead of constantly using Toolbox.CleanName
	  to 'fix' the names of Properties. More refactoring for the Property
	  stuff

2007-08-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs,
	  LunarEclipse.mdp, gtk-gui/LunarEclipse.Properties.cs,

	  Properties/PropertyType.cs, Properties/IPropertyGroup.cs,
	  Serialization/PropertyData.cs, Serialization/Serializer.cs,
	  Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Partial refactoring for the Property

	  Properties/PropertyGroupLayout.cs: Switched some things over to using
	  the Toolbox.ChangeProperty method

2007-08-14  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/Selector.cs, Controller/UndoActions/UndoPropertyChange.cs,
	  Controller/Toolbox.cs: Added in supporting code so i have events when a
	  property changes. Updated 2 sections of code to use this new code to
	  make animation recording slicker

2007-08-13  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/StoryboardManager.cs: Using the resolver so that the correct
	  properties are updated
	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Created a new 'Resolver' which can
	  resolve the property paths (i.e.
	  (UIElement.RenderTransform).(TransformGroup.Children)[3].(TranslateTransform.X)
	  ) down to a specific DependencyObject and DependencyProperty.

2007-08-13  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  Namegenerator
	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Controls/TimeLine/KeyframeMarker.cs,
	  Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs: Moving keyframes on the timeline

2007-08-08  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs: Removed stacktrace writing

2007-08-08  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  ;)

2007-08-08  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* View/MainWindow.cs: 'Start' button is unneccessary

2007-08-08  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  serialized or when you try to select/animate them.

2007-08-07  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs: Fixed several bugs involving setting the first
	  keyframe and seeking

2007-08-07  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs: Fixed a bug where i wasn't using
	  TotalMilliseconds.

2007-08-07  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* View/MainWindow.cs: Hiding the controls when the record draw is disabled

2007-08-07  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  width/heiht on the  child

2007-08-06  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs: Correctly recording the changing movements.
	* LunarEclipse.mdp, Serialization/Serializer.cs,
	  Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: The serializer is now much faster
	  than before as i have a white-list of attached properties which i need
	  to check as opposed to brute forcing everything.
	* Serialization/PropertyData.cs: Storing more information than before (such
	  as whether the property is attached or not) which greatly simplifies
	  usage of the data.

2007-08-06  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs, Properties/PropertyGroupLayout.cs,
	  Properties/PropertyGroupAppearance.cs: Commented out the property code
	  until it can be changed to work with the new data structures

	Cosmetic

2007-08-02  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  the change to inheriting from Control instead of shape

2007-08-02  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Initial refactor to make things compliant with the refresh.

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	The rotation undo'ing now works right. I misunderstood attached properties ;)

2007-07-31  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Model/Draw/Selector.cs,
	  Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs, Model/Draw/DrawBase.cs,
	  Controller/UndoEngine.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs,
	  LunarEclipse.mdp: Seperated out the selection code out so that it
	  can be reused for the Animation recorder. Events kick ass ;)

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Rather than storing an Undo item for every small change in one group, if there is an existing undo object that changes the same property, it is updated instead

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs, Controller/UndoActions/UndoMoveShape.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoActionBase.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoPropertyChange.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoGroup.cs,
	  Controller/UndoActions/UndoAddObject.cs, LunarEclipse.mdp: Now
	  using the new UndoGroup. Greatly simplifies the undo logic for
	  events that change multiple properties at the same time.

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* LunarEclipse.mdp: Update the undo code to be able to undo rotations
	  in a transform group

2007-07-27  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Cosmetic

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Bugfix: Now plays nicely with a TransformGroup as the RenderTransform as opposed to a rotateTransform

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/SelectedBorder.cs, Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Switched to
	  using TransformGroup rather than an actual RotateTransform

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	An angle of -10 actually corresponds to a true angle of 350. This fixes rotating with a negative angle

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Switching to the XAML view cleans up the current draw item in a better way

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controller/MoonlightController.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/DrawBase.cs, Controller/MoonlightController.cs: Fixed the
	  bug where the SelectionDraw wasn't preparing until the first mouse
	  click (which meant it wouldn't select on the first mouse click)

2007-07-26  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/RecordDraw.cs, Controller/Recorder.cs,
	  Controls/TimeLine/KeyframeMarker.cs,

	  correctly displayed onscreen now

2007-07-25  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Controls/TimeLine/AnimationTimeline.cs: Now moving existing shapes
	  around the canvas rather than clearing the children and creating
	  new visuals each time. Much faster.

2007-07-25  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Added the Recorder class used for recording animations

2007-07-25  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com>

	  incrementing twice.

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Cosmetic

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Added a comment explaining the need for the crazy math

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Refactored the code to be much shorter

2007-07-20  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Resizing now works for all rotation angles

2007-07-18  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Implemented a bit more of the code
	  needed for resizing shapes while rotated.

2007-07-18  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	w00t! I can resize without the shape shifting position

2007-07-18  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	Always set a default when using the color changer. Misc cleanups

2007-07-17  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 

	* Properties/Properties.cs: Added in supporting code for the Brush
	  group
	* Properties/PropertyGroupBrushes.cs: Initial implementation of the
	  PropertyGroup for brushes
	* Properties/PropertyGroupLayout.cs: Updated to use the
	  ReflectionHelper
	* Properties/PropertyGroup.cs: Bugfixed the SelectedBorder property
	* Properties/PropertyGroupAppearance.cs: Using Enum helper methods
	  where appropriate. Using ReflectionHelper. Fixes so operations are
	  performed on the selected shape rather than the selection canvas
	  surrounding that shape.
	* Serialization/Serializer.cs: updated to work with the new static
	  reflection helper
	* Serialization/ReflectionHelper.cs: Reflection helper is now a
	  threadsafe static class.

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	Display the type of the object that is selected

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Shape cannot be forced into 'negative'
	  widht/height through resizing now.

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	* Model/Draw/SelectionDraw.cs: Selecting/deselecting is now a lot
	  faster when using the selection rectangle. I don't regenerate the
	  entire list of selected shapes every time.

2007-07-16  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com> 

	Added partial support for recalculating the width/height when resizing diagonally so the shape doesn't move.
